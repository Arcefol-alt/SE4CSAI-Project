Generated Description: I have a few other dogs on the street and gave birth to these puppies. Since they was born in late November, we decided to let them go as our friends couldn't keep their baby anymore because there were so many of them outside: Buchsej is very active and playful but due to the big size that this puppy must be used for feeding food from time to time. The pet lovers can give them all the heart-loving love, care and patience you deserve. They want to take some help with this type of dog... It will make me cry when it came at my house car too. So please do contact me or whatsapp/Sandbox (which does not allow us to talk about animals). Thanks!

Generated Description: Hi, i found the puppy in his neighbourhood but my dog came home on day 2 of August. I was alone trying to find someone who interested? It's very sad that it is not quite like this dog being petted and abandoned by our friend’ only sister. However please give me an email or we will call him for adoption as soon as possible because no one can take care of her since they are all old enough. But if you agree to get along well with other dogs at home without any hesitation, she must be neutered when there were lots too many puppies around before adopting/loverage some toys; then...I dont hesitate to let go: Please do inform me about your family situation which involves taking them back together. So would love more cats! If you need help keeping these pups (even though its so lucky) nor am I lost even further into your lives due to heavy rain now. The puppy needs a permanent loving home. Also, he seems shy away from people here once u start living room etc). He is healthy, friendly and playful. Will bring up for vaccination after 3 month

She was very well fed by people who are eagerly waiting out more time after adopting them at home so I can't give him up due to lack of proper care as there were many others than these one.
